The normal of a vertex is calculated by using the vertex point along with the two other vertex points in the triangle. The normal is then the cross product between the vectors formed between the two set of points. The surface normal is then obtained by interpolating the normals along a vertex and then interpolating between two points on different vertices. By using the cross product to obtain the vertex normals it means that the same vertex point can have different normals when calculated as a part of different triangles. This has ill affect on the smoothness of a surface since any point on the surface can only have one surface normal, i.e. surface can seem more rough than it is.
